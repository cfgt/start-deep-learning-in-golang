# Getting Started with Deep Learning in Go
This is meant to be a quick and simple resource to help jump start you into doing deep learning in Go.

Currently, it includes one MNIST feedforward and one MNIST autoencoder example - the hope is that this will help and inspire you to train and build more deep learning models in Go!

You can download the MNIST data at:
